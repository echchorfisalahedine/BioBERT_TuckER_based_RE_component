Biomedical  Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Embedding Models and Ontologies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code contained in the notebook represents the RE component introduced in the paper. 
It involves training a new scoring function based on the TuckER method ( learning a new core tensor and relation embeddings) on triples extracted from a biomedical ontology (MONDO).
The data files associated with the notebook contain the triples used for testing the component and are presented to recreate the experimental results reported in the paper.
